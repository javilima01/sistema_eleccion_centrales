# Description

This project was developed using the **MEAN stack** along with a **Python Flask microservice**. It was presented in the finals of the **HPE CDS TECH CHALLENGE 2023**, achieving **second place out of 65 teams** from universities across Spain.

The solution addresses the problem of determining which power plants should supply energy to specific areas of a city, based on factors such as emissions, costs, and a “penalty” depending on the intended use of the energy produced. The system allows selecting which city areas to supply and which plants to discard, while also considering meteorological conditions.

It proposes an alternative to non-renewable energy production, water waste, and the resulting scarcity, while also accounting for climate-related factors. The project aligns with **Goals 6 and 7 of the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development**, aiming for a more sustainable future.

# Usage

To simplify the deployment and use of the system, **Docker** is integrated.

Use the following commands to run it:

- `docker-compose build`  
- `docker-compose up`

      Enjoy!
